  <div class="about">
    <h2>FruitJuic3</h2>
    <p>I am one of the Co-Founders of Dox Studios. I primarily work as the lead programmer as well as the one in charge of making sure all the design concepts fit together well. In addition to game development, I help in the company's secondary endeavours, such as the construction of stuff like computer mice and drones.</p>

  <div class="about">
    <h2>Dragontoothjones</h2>
    <p>Hey! I'm the other Co-founder for Dox Studios! I primarly work within the Game Development Department of the studio, contributing to some games while making others of my own to present to the team. I have some contributions towards A Snail's Pace, and I'm the main artist for Catacombs. Other than that, I also manage some other secondary things within the company, such as book writing, and lead innovator.</p>

    <h2>CowCat55</h2>
    <p>Hi! I'm the main level designer and the guy with contacts (ok not contacts, a singular contact). I got into game development when I was about 10, but I realized I suck at coding and decided to completely forget about it for like 5 years. I then found out I'm decent at level designing. Some my favorite games are ocarina of time and imperishable night.</p>

  <div class="about">
    <h2>Computer Fan Man</h2>
    <p>The strange events and coincidences that led to my involvement and partnership with the Dox Studios team still baffles me, but they do not go unappreciated. I am the lead artistic mind on A Snail's Pace, surpasser of all word counts, and the primary supplier of poor ideas that have somehow turned into a surprisingly fun game to both experience as a player and a developer, specifically in retrospect. In retrospect I'm enjoying myself. In retrospect I am also heavily underpayed.</p>

  <div class="about">
    <h2>Eviotie</h2>
    <p>I'm the primary engineer on the hardware side of Dox Studios. I contribute to projects such as computer mice and drones. I handle interfacing our components properly and designing models for our products to ensure a quality size and feel. I ensure that as our technology progresses we are always innovating to provide the latest features and best designs to our customers.</p>
